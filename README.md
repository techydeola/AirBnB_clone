<p>The AirBnB Project is the second group project in ALX sprint two. In this propect we are to implement a console prompt where we manipulate data without a visual interface, something like a Shell prompt. <br> The console does the following:</p>

1. Create your data model
2. Manage (create, update, destroy, count, retrive) object via console / command interpreter
3. Store and persis object of a file (JSON file)

### Storage System For This Project
<p>In pharse we to collect the data the user input, manipute it an store it in a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between the MyObject and "How they stored and persisted". Now using this abstraction allows us to change the type of storsge without affecting our program for this project.</p>

### Data Diagram For This Project
<p>In this project we are to implement it using OOP (Object Oriented Progrmming) in Python, where we create classes, instanace and methods. so therfore we will have One BaseModel that handle common called methods and and instance, this will act the primary class model, so it will be inheritaned to other classe. Here is the data diagram for this project.</p>

<p>So in the above explanation we are going to implement and define the following for each propery in the class and store them, retrieve them when used by the user and delete it by the user.</p>
